I’m a Ph.D.-trained scientist in Molecular Biosciences and Bioengineering with a passion for working at the intersection of biology, data, and ideas. My background spans RNA and small RNA biology, genomics, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence, and I enjoy bringing experimental and computational approaches together to make sense of complex biological systems. 

Over the past decade, I’ve built extensive experience in scientific writing and communication, including drafting manuscripts, technical documents, novelty and prior-art analyses, and detailed responses to peer review. My research training includes six years of oncology-focused work and ten first-author publications, and I genuinely enjoy the process of refining ideas, telling scientific stories, and bridging gaps between disciplines.

Outside of work, I love getting outdoors and staying active. You’ll often find me hiking, snorkeling, or training Brazilian jiu-jitsu as a proud blue belt. I also enjoy creative writing and reading, and I’m always excited to learn something new, whether it’s a research concept, a new trail, or a fresh perspective.
