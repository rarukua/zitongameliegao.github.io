I’m a Ph.D.-trained scientist in Molecular Biosciences and Bioengineering with a passion for working at the intersection of biology, data, and ideas, and a USPTO registered patent agent. My background spans RNA and small RNA biology, genomics, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence, and I enjoy bringing experimental and computational approaches together to make sense of complex biological systems. I am particularly interested in exploring the diagnostic potential of small RNAs in oncology, which are abundant in the human body, and in understanding how these small RNA fragments regulate biological processes during tumorigenesis. 

Over the past decade, I’ve built extensive experience in performing bioinformatics analyses across multiple omics platforms, including bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, DNA sequencing (somatic variant analysis and targeted sequencing panels), and epigenomics workflows. I also bring strong expertise in scientific writing and communication, with experience drafting manuscripts, technical documents, novelty and prior-art analyses, and detailed responses to peer review. My research training includes six years of oncology-focused work and ten first-author publications, and I genuinely enjoy refining ideas, telling scientific stories, and bridging gaps between disciplines.

Outside of work, I love getting outdoors and staying active. You’ll often find me hiking, snorkeling, or training Brazilian jiu-jitsu as a proud blue belt. I also enjoy creative writing and reading, and I’m always excited to learn something new, whether it’s a research concept, a new trail, or a fresh perspective.
