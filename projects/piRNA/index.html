Detecting NSCLC at the early stage can decrease the mortality rate and minimize harm caused by various treatments. We curated 2,050 samples from public tissue and plasma datasets including both invasive and non-invasive types, then supplemented with in-house pooled plasma and exosome samples. Eleven independent transcriptome datasets were utilized to develop a new machine learning model by integrating PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) to predict NSCLC. Five piRNA signatures derived from ribosomal subunits identified to be tumor-specific exhibited robust diagnostic ability and were combined into a piRNA-Based Tumor Probability Index (pi-TPI) risk evaluation model. pi-TPI effectively distinguished NSCLC patients from healthy individuals and showed efficacy in identifying early-stage cancers with Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) values over 0.80. Plasma cohorts exhibited the diagnosis efficacy of pi-TPI with an AUC value of 0.85. Experimental exosomal data enhances the accuracy of diagnosing non-cancerous, benign, and cancer cases. The pi-TPI marker in the non-cancer/cancer subgroup exhibited superior predictive performance with an AUC value of 0.96. These findings underscore the significant clinical potential of the five piRNA signatures as a powerful diagnostic tool for NSCLC, particularly of non-invasive cancer diagnostics.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/piTPI/graphical_abstract-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/piTPI/graphical_abstract-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/piTPI/graphical_abstract-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/piTPI/graphical_abstract.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Graphical abstract of the pi-TPI model for NSCLC diagnosis" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p><img src="assets/img/piTPI/figure1.jpg" alt="Overview"></p> <hr> <h2 id="model-architecture">Model Architecture</h2> <p>The model uses dual T5-style encoders with contrastive learning and EMA distillation to capture non-canonical interactions.</p> <p><img src="assets/img/projects/comims/model.png" alt="Model"></p> <hr> <h2 id="results">Results</h2> <p>COMIMS outperforms existing tools across multiple benchmarks and transcript regions.</p> <p><img src="assets/img/projects/comims/results.png" alt="Results"></p> <hr> <h2 id="key-contributions">Key Contributions</h2> <ul> <li>Transcript-wide miRNA target prediction (CDS, UTR3)</li> <li>CLASH-seq–driven supervision</li> <li>Attention heatmap interpretability</li> </ul> </body></html>
