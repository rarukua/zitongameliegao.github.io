tRNA-derived fragment (tRDF) is novel small non-coding RNA that presences in different types of cancer. The comprehensive understanding of tRDFs in non-small cell lung cancer remains largely unknown. In this study, 1550 patient samples of NSCLC were included, and 52 tRDFs with four subtypes were identified. Six tRDFs were picked as diagnostic signatures based on the tRDFs expression patterns, and under the curve (AUC) in independent validations is up to 0.90. Two signatures were validated successfully in plasma samples, and six signatures were confirmed the consistency of distinguished expression in NSCLC cell lines. Ten tRDFs along with independent risk scores can be used to predict survival outcomes by stages, 5a_tRF-Ile-AAT/GAT can be prognosis biomarker for early stage. Association analysis of tRDFs signatures correlated mRNAs and miRNA were targeted to the cell cycle and oocyte meiosis signaling pathways. Five tRDFs were assessed to associate with PD-L1 immune checkpoint and correlated with the genes that targets in PD-L1 checkpoint signaling pathway. Our study is the first to provide a comprehensive analysis of tRDFs in lung cancer including four subtypes of tRDFs, investigating the diagnostic and prognostic values, and demonstrated their biological function and transcriptional role as well as potential immune therapeutic value.
